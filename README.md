Provides database and API integration to give access to a website/app for grass roots players to keep track of their stats.


## History  ##
Starting as an Excel spreadsheet (what database isn't), it became apparent that players wanted to see more stats and more of an 
admin burden to try to keep on top of each player's involvements within matches. With that in mind, a database was planned around
keeping on top of such things while also opening the door for more than just one team, then it also became apparent that it could
be done over multiple leagues / tournaments or even just friendlies. The other options to keep track of it involved rather hefty
monthly subscriptions where you're forced to use a specific website or make do with a limited app that just didn't tick all the boxes.
So it was decided that it would be beneficial to make one from the ground up using data already collected and present it to the rest of
the world for anyone to use.

## Sponsorship ##
All development is done by volunteers, hosting is provided by one of the devs for free. Any sponsorship would be very welcome but is not
requested or demanded.
